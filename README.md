This is a simplified version of a common card game, "21". Blackjack is a better-known variant.
In this game, the dealer deals two "cards" to each player, one hidden, so that only the player who gets it knows what it is, and one face up, so that everyone can see it. (Actually, what the other players see is the total of each other player's cards, not the individual cards.)

The players then take turns requesting cards, trying to get as close to 21 as possible, but not going over 21. A player may pass (ask for no more cards). Once a player has passed, he or she cannot later ask for another card. When all players have passed, the game ends.

The winner is the player who has come closest to 21 without exceeding it. In the case of a tie, or if everyone goes over 21, no one wins.

Simplifications:

<li>The game is only played once (so it's actually just one "hand").</li>
<li>"Cards" are the numbers 1 through 10.</li>
<li>There is nothing special about the "Ace" or about any other card.</li>
<li>Cards are randomly generated, not drawn from a deck of limited size.</li>
